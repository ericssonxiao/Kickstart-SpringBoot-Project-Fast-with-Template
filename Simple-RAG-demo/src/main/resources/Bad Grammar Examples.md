## _5 bad grammar examples to avoid  
_

When speaking or writing, grammar is one of the most powerful representations of intelligence and authority. Right or wrong, people will form opinions based on the way you present yourself—similar to the way a well-tailored business suit helps project competence. If you want people to note your opinions rather than your bad grammar examples, avoid these common errors. You can also take our online course and spend a bit of time learning English grammar.

### **1\. S****ubject–verb agreement errors**

One basic rule of English grammar is that the subject (the one performing the action) must agree in number with the verb (the action or state of being). For example, in the sentence “Matt plays the guitar,” both _Matt_ and _plays_ are singular, so this subject and verb agree. However, most sentences, especially in academic writing, aren’t so straightforward. Descriptive phrases can get in the way, making it difficult to determine if the subjects and verbs agree. When this happens, eliminate all intervening information to get to the meat of the sentence.

-   **Incorrect:** The girl with the black and white puppies have a ball.

Because _puppies_ is right before _have_, this bad grammar example is easy to overlook. Ask yourself who the sentence is about (the girl), and eliminate the rest:

-   **Correct:** The girl has a ball.

### **2\. Pronoun–antecedent agreement errors**

Like subjects and verbs, pronouns must agree with their antecedents, the nouns they replace. They must agree in both number and gender. Typically, this is easy, as in the following example:

-   **Correct**: _Yolanda_ has _her_ notebook.

However, with certain words, it is more difficult to determine whether they are singular or plural. For instance, indefinite pronouns (such as _someone_, _anyone_, _few_, _none_, or _everyone_) confuse many English speakers, as in this bad grammar example:

-   **Incorrect:** _Everyone_ needs to bring _their_ pencil.

Here, _everyone_ is singular, so the pronoun before _pencil_ must be as well. It would be more grammatically correct to say:

-   **Correct:** _Everyone_ needs to bring _his or her_ pencil.

Note that many modern English speakers use the plural _their_ to avoid gender-biased language, especially in informal speech. If writing an academic paper, consult your style guide or professor to determine whether this is acceptable.

### **3\. Sentence errors**

To be a complete sentence, a group of words must begin with a capital letter, have ending punctuation (a period, question mark, or exclamation point), and express a complete thought. While most people understand the first two requirements, it’s the third that causes problems, with errors often resulting in sentence fragments or run-on sentences. Consider these bad grammar examples:

-   **Incorrect:** Because I wanted to go on a picnic.
-   **Incorrect:** When Al gets here.
-   **Incorrect:** Lisa went to the concert, she saw the band.

The first two bad grammar examples are incorrect because they don’t express complete thoughts: What happened because the speaker wanted to go on a picnic? What will happen when Al gets here? To correct this error, you must add an independent clause to complete the thought.

-   **Correct:** I brought a blanket because I wanted to go on a picnic.
-   **Correct:** When Al gets here, we can start making dinner.

Adding the independent clause completes the thought, facilitating understanding. The third bad grammar example is a run-on sentence; it provides too many complete thoughts without connecting them appropriately. To correct this, add a coordinating conjunction (_for_, _and_, _nor_, _but_, _or_, _yet_, _so_) after the comma, change the comma to a semicolon, or make two sentences.

-   **Correct:** Lisa went to the concert, and she saw the band.
-   **Correct:** Lisa went to the concert; she saw the band.
-   **Correct:** Lisa went to the concert. She saw the band.

### **4\. Descriptive phrase errors**

Descriptive phrases can add depth and clarity to writing, but can also result in bad grammar examples. When writing, be sure your descriptive phrase is attached to the right word, and be sure to put your work through editing to avoid these common mistakes.

-   **Incorrect:** Smelling like rotten fish, my sister took the trash out.
-   **Incorrect:** Watching from the airplane window, the volcano erupted.

The first bad grammar example, implying that your sister needs a bath, involves a misplaced modifier. The phrase should be describing _trash_.

-   **Correct:** My sister took out the trash, which smelled like rotten fish.

The second bad grammar example leaves readers wondering who was on the plane—because it sure seems like the volcano was having a great trip. To correct this dangling modifier, add an appropriate subject:

-   **Correct:** Watching from the airplane window, I saw the volcano erupt.

While the above errors are sometimes difficult to catch, the bad grammar examples below can be a little bit more obvious (though they can still stump even experienced editors at times!)

### **5\. Homonyms**

Certain pairs or groups of words are confusing because they are similar but have different meanings. Review the following homonyms to avoid appearing lazy or uninformed and infusing your writing with more bad grammar examples.

**It’s/Its:** _It’s_ is a contraction meaning _It is_ or _It has_. _Its_ is a possessive pronoun.

-   **Incorrect:** _Its_ going to be a long day. Does the car need _it’s_ oil changed?

-   **Correct:** _It’s_ going to be a long day. Does the car need _its_ oil changed?

**There/Their/They’re:** _There_ is either a place or a pronoun. _Their_ is a possessive pronoun. _They’re_ is a contraction meaning _They are_.

-   **Incorrect:** _Their_ goes my freedom. _There_ going to bring _they’re_ suitcases.

-   **Correct:** _There_ goes my freedom. _They’re_ going to bring _their_ suitcases.

**Your/You’re:** Like the above examples, _your_ is a possessive pronoun, while _you’re_ is a contraction for _you are_.

-   **Incorrect:** _Your_ going to need _you’re_ notebook.

-   **Correct:** _You’re_ going to need _your_ notebook.

**Affect/Effect:** Most of the time, _affect_ is a verb, and _effect_ is a noun.

-   **Incorrect:** That medicine _effects_ my ability to sleep. Have you heard of the butterfly _affect_?

-   **Correct:** That medicine _affects_ my ability to sleep. Have you heard of the butterfly _effect_?

**Note:** While this is an easy distinction, in certain cases, _affect_ can be a noun, such as in psychology, and _effect_ can be a verb meaning _to accomplish_.

Homonyms can be tricky even for experienced English speakers, so make a list of the ones you confuse most and check for them each time you write.

### **That’s all, folks!**

By watching out for all these errors, you can present yourself in the best possible light, whether you’re writing an informal email or a university dissertation.
